I am not providing the regular Daily diary. I am sorry.

I used this course to refresh my knowledge about webdesign.
In my previous study at my home university, I learned 2 semesters about webdesign.
But I have to say that at my home university I was not that motivated to produce such a beautiful project.
And this project will be in my portfolio.
The videos which were provided taught me that it is also possible to create a responsive design
without complicated, long, pre-programmed code that's hard to understand. @media in a .css file was new to
me and I realy liked it. Because I was so motivated I programmed the Responsive Masonry Layout. It is
a kind of pinterest layout and i realy liked it so I programmed it.
In the beginning I had to struggle with the menubar but I was able to fix it and I was able to
programm the responsive mansonry layout.
Pushing the whole project to github was also a new and in the beginning a confusing task but 
I managed it and I was capable to develop the project on git hub pages but somehow only my index.html site was published
and I could not find the mistake.
